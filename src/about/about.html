                            Cristina is a software developer and continuous learner who has had the opportunity to work in R+D+i departments designing and building software for the citizens of the future.
                            She discovered her passion for software by creating digital, interactive maps using Geographic Information Systems technologies like ArcGis and maintaning GIS databases while studying environmental engineering in Barcelona.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            She understands very well that due to society evolution business also evolves, In consequence, software has to be crafted in a way that it is resilient and flexible allowing constant adaption to changes in the environment. She has joined Codurance because she knows that crafting software in such a way, requires a high level of mastery, dedication, and passion. Also, she is aware about the key role that data plays in the present, and the challenges that its management brings into the tech scene; accordingly, she has special interest in the data engineering field.
                            Over the years, she has sharpened an holistic thinking when approaching problem solving and combines her analytical skills together with creative thinking to reach valid and innovative solutions to the challenges that we face day by day.

                        <p>
                            She constantly looks for ways to give back to the community what she receives from it. In her opinion, collaboration between peers, collectivity and mutualism are the key to success.
                            During her free time, she enjoys listening to music, specially rockabilly and garage. She loves films and documentaries and has taken the personal challenge of reducing her carbon footprint.

                        <p>
                            Her thinking is: Let’s awaken our humanity so we build more humane companies. Let us be the change and we will see the change in society. Let’s get involved and take action, because today we are creating the future.
                            As an engineer, I combine my analytical skills together with creative thinking to reach valid and innovative solutions to the challenges that we entrepreneurs face day by day.
                            Thanks to my experience as a product developer, she can help you to implement agile methodologies in non-technological projects. 
                        </p>

                            As ‘Green thinker’, I approach bussiness developement based on biomimetism, that is, imitating Nature to generate succesfully adapted businnes ventures. Collaboration between peers, collectivity and mutualism are the key to success.</p>
